# Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning | End-to-End Python Project

Learn how to build a Customer Churn Prediction Project using Machine Learning in Python! 🚀
In this full end-to-end tutorial, we’ll predict customer churn using real-world bank data and explore how data-driven insights can help businesses retain their valuable customers.

This Customer Churn Prediction Machine Learning Project is perfect for data science, AI, and ML enthusiasts who want to build a real-world project for their portfolio and understand how predictive modeling works in business applications.

We’ll cover everything — from data preprocessing, feature engineering, and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to model training, evaluation, and visualization — all explained step-by-step using Python.

🧠 What You’ll Learn:

✅ How to preprocess and clean structured data
✅ Perform in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find patterns
✅ Engineer meaningful features like Balance, Tenure, and Product Usage
✅ Build and compare ML models — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
✅ Evaluate performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC
✅ Visualize churn trends and customer behavior using Seaborn & Matplotlib
✅ Understand how businesses can use churn prediction for customer retention strategies
